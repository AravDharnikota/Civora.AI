    "text": "\"War Is Peace, Ignorance is Strength and (By the Way) I am Striking Your Motion from the Record”by Janet PhelanSaturday, Sep 27, 2025 - 4:10Nowhere is the intentional inversion of language more salient than in the legal realm. While a significant assault on our thoughts and beliefs is now taking place regularly in multiple spheres, including the media and political forums, nowhere is the intentional obfuscation of reality clearer than in our courts.As a matter of preparation for the contentions me in this article, I urge all reers to attend to this article which discusses the use of the word “fascism.” Why the Word ‘Fascist’ Has Lost All Meaning — and How Politicians Are Exploiting It | by Karthik Karunakaran, Ph.D. | Medium The writer contends that “In today’s heated political climate, one word seems to be thrown around more than any other: fascist. But what does it actually mean anymore? The term has become so diluted, misused, and weaponized that its original weight and significance have all but disappeared. Politicians have caught on to this — and they’re using it to manipulate the masses. Here’s why the word “fascist” has lost all meaning and how it’s being used to sway public opinion in ways that should concern us all.” One might also want to check out this article by none other than George Orwell, who is concerned that the word “fascist” is used to describe anyone with whom one disagrees. George Orwell: What is Fascism? - Intellectual Takeout In the preface to the article, the ministrator notes that “Accusations of fascism are tossed around like candy at a Fourth of July pare. It’s been this way for a long time. Anything that hints of some person or some group not getting to do whatever they want or with which there is violent disagreement is often labeled fascist. Today is no different.”Armed with an understanding how political speech has been compromised, you might also want to view this recent video on the inversion of language by anthropologist Francisco Gil-White. 1984 in 2025 When Saving Lives Is Called ‘G*nocide’ 1984 in 2025 When Saving Lives Is Called ‘G*nocide’So let’s talk about the courts as purveyors of nonsense language. Earlier work has connected the Nazi T-4 program with court-authorized ult guardianships and elder abuse in the US The Nazification of US Domestic Policy | ZeroHedge. It has been noted the alarming tendency of the US to name its killing programs as the opposite. Therefore, the words describing ult guardianships as something intended to protect the elderly need to be viewed as contrary to their reality. Over and over again, these guardianships have been proven to accomplish the exact opposite and have resulted in predation of the assets of the wards as well as outright medicalized attacks on their viability Are the Elderly Being Dosed with Dangerous Antipsychotic Drugs? | ZeroHedge. In plain language, this is called \"theft” and “murder.\" Pursuant to these documented perceptions, this reporter has focused her attention on the judges in these cases. A particular mechanism, involving fraudulent home loans, has been uncovered and widely employed as a vehicle for these judges to receive bribes and payoffs for throwing these cases.Fundamentally, the scam works in this way: Judge X takes out a loan and Y pays it back.Recently, an article concerning the efforts of a brave attorney was published by Zerohedge. The attorney, Paul Cook, was attempting to recuse a judge who appears to have irregularities in his mortgage transactions, which you can re about here: H. 170.1 Judge Kalra This judge appears to have issued one erroneous ruling after another against attorney Cook and was publicly and rather relentlessly making disparaging and unprofessional comments about Cook.In the process of researching the article concerning Cook’s efforts to remove judge Kalra from his case this reporter came across another effort to recuse a LA Superior Court judge from a case. This effort was accompanied by no less than SEVENTEEN declarations by attorneys who h h the misfortune of appearing before judge Murphy. These declarations repeatedly revealed that judge Mary Ann Murphy was deprecating in her verbiage towards numerous attorneys and publicly me insulting comments about them. 17 attorneys seek disqualification of LA judge citing bias, abuseBut the judge prevailed here as well, and Murphy refused to step off the case. Unlike the petitioner in the above cited case, Paul Cook is moving ahe with his intention to remove the problematic judge from his case and will be shortly filing an appeal. It is in Cook’s judge’s response to the Motion to Recuse that we find the Orwellian verbiage. Judge Upinder Kalra has indeed refused to accede to the Motion to Recuse and has ordered it to be stricken from the record. This means that the Motion to Recuse will be treated as if it does not exist. That in itself is redolent of Orwell's Ministry of Truth, which was regularly scrambling to delete politically inconvenient events from the \"official\" record.A scrutiny of judge Kalra’s response to Cook’s Motion reveals that while Kalra does not take direct issue with the revelations of financial impropriety discussed in the Motion, he dismisses all of Cook’s concerns and states “Because the Statement is untimely, and does not disclose, on its face, any legal grounds for disqualification, the Court strikes it pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.4(b).” Judge Kalra's Order Strike Disqualification-minHe goes on to declare that Cook should have recused him back in February, rather than waiting until September and his recusal attempt is therefore “untimely,” rather than buttressed by the longevity of the judge’s rude and unprofessional language. Judge Kalra also references Cook’s concerns about his financial activities, stating that “…Plaintiff baselessly contends that there are certain financial irregularities in Judge Kalra’s real estate and corporate stock transactions that warrant disqualification; Plaintiff bases this allegation on financial disclosures dated February 24, 2020, February 15, 2021, and February 25, 2025.”However, this statement is untrue as Cook only recently h reason to become curious about Kalra, and it was at that point a source informed him of investigating his mortgages. The possibility that Kalra was using his real estate transactions to fraudulently self-enrich was thus not on Cook‘s rar until very recently. The use of mortgages to launder money is called “loanbacking” and is discussed here Loan Back Method of Money Laundering | Compliance AlertJudge Kalra has executed nearly $4 million in such transactions. He ascended to the bench in 2010, having been appointed by Governor Schwarzenegger and was previously employed in a government job for about twenty years. Hon. Upinder Kalra - Beverly Hills Bar AssociationFollowing the publication last week of the initial article stating concerns about Kalra’s loan and financial activity, Groundbreaking Court Filing Targets Judicial Corruption | ZeroHedge Kalra is \"reconsidering whether Cook could go forward\" with his lawsuit against the notary, whom Cook is claiming fraudulently allowed a loan of $730,000 to be affixed to his D. Kalra h claimed that Cook “h no evidence\", but since the ZH article was published, Kalra appears more open-minded that evidence exists against the notary. It should be noted that Cook has significant evidence against the notary, who was pivotal in executing the financial elder abuse scheme against Cook’s father, a scheme which judge Kalra may be trying to shield and protect. And it wouldn’t be the first time that a judge tried to protect elder abuse.

Earlier work has connected the Nazi T-4 program with court-authorized adult guardianships and elder abuse in the US <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-08-12/nazification-us-domestic-policy-peek-comparison-between-hitlers-t-4-and-adult\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">The Nazification of US Domestic Policy | ZeroHedge</a>. It has been noted the alarming tendency of the US to name its killing programs as the opposite. Therefore, the words describing adult guardianships as something intended to protect the elderly need to be viewed as contrary to their reality. Over and over again, these guardianships have been proven to accomplish the exact opposite and have resulted in predation of the assets of the wards as well as outright medicalized attacks on their viability  <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-03-24/are-elderly-being-dosed-dangerous-antipsychotic-drugs\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Are the Elderly Being Dosed with Dangerous Antipsychotic Drugs? | ZeroHedge</a>. </p><p>In plain language, this is called \"theft” and “murder.\" </p><p>Pursuant to these documented perceptions, this reporter has focused her attention on the judges in these cases. A particular mechanism, involving fraudulent home loans, has been uncovered and widely employed as a vehicle for these judges to receive bribes and payoffs for throwing these cases.</p><p>Fundamentally, the scam works in this way: Judge X takes out a loan and Y pays it back.</p><div class=\"in-content\" id=\"in-content-2\"></div><p>Recently, an article concerning the efforts of a brave attorney was published by Zerohedge. The attorney, Paul Cook, was attempting to recuse a judge who appears to have irregularities in his mortgage transactions, which you can read about here: <a href=\"https://jumpshare.com/s/zHadS31bQm6zGE27vIcs\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">H. 170.1 Judge Kalra</a> This judge appears to have issued one erroneous ruling after another against attorney Cook and was publicly and rather relentlessly making disparaging and unprofessional comments about Cook.</p><p>In the process of researching the article concerning Cook’s efforts to remove judge Kalra from his case this reporter came across another effort to recuse a LA Superior Court judge from a case. This effort was accompanied by no less than SEVENTEEN declarations by attorneys who had had the misfortune of appearing before judge Murphy. These declarations repeatedly revealed that judge Mary Ann Murphy was deprecating in her verbiage towards numerous attorneys and publicly made insulting comments about them. <a href=\"https://www.dailyjournal.com/article/384498-17-attorneys-seek-disqualification-of-la-judge-citing-bias-abuse\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">17 attorneys seek disqualification of LA judge citing bias, abuse</a></p><p>But the judge prevailed here as well, and Murphy refused to step off the case. Unlike the petitioner in the above cited case, Paul Cook is moving ahead with his intention to remove the problematic judge from his case and will be shortly filing an appeal.</p><p> It is in Cook’s judge’s response to the Motion to Recuse that we find the Orwellian verbiage. Judge Upinder Kalra has indeed refused to accede to the Motion to Recuse and has ordered it to be stricken from the record. This means that the Motion to Recuse will be treated as if it does not exist. That in itself is redolent of Orwell's Ministry of Truth, which was regularly scrambling to delete politically inconvenient events from the \"official\" record.</p><p>A scrutiny of judge Kalra’s response to Cook’s Motion reveals that while Kalra does not take direct issue with the revelations of financial impropriety discussed in the Motion, he dismisses all of Cook’s concerns and states “Because the Statement is untimely, and does not disclose, on its face, any legal grounds for disqualification, the Court strikes it pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.4(b).” <a href=\"https://jumpshare.com/s/FljDLIgYxr4NTAhNP8Z6\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Judge Kalra's Order Strike Disqualification-min</a></p><p>He goes on to declare that Cook should have recused him back in February, rather than waiting until September and his recusal attempt is therefore “untimely,” rather than buttressed by the longevity of the judge’s rude and unprofessional language. Judge Kalra also references Cook’s concerns about his financial activities, stating that “…Plaintiff baselessly contends that there are certain financial irregularities in Judge Kalra’s real estate and corporate stock transactions that warrant disqualification; Plaintiff bases this allegation on financial disclosures dated February 24, 2020, February 15, 2021, and February 25, 2025.”</p><p>However, this statement is untrue as Cook only recently had reason to become curious about Kalra, and it was at that point a source informed him of investigating his mortgages. The possibility that Kalra was using his real estate transactions to fraudulently self-enrich was thus not on Cook‘s radar until very recently. The use of mortgages to launder money is called “loanbacking” and is discussed here <a href=\"https://www.compliancealert.org/view-blog/54/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Loan Back Method of Money Laundering | Compliance Alert</a></p><div class=\"in-content\" id=\"in-content-3\"></div><p>Judge Kalra has executed nearly $4 million in such transactions. He ascended to the bench in 2010, having been appointed by Governor Schwarzenegger and was previously employed in a government job for about twenty years. <a href=\"https://bhba.org/speakers/hon-upinder-kalra/\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Hon. Upinder Kalra - Beverly Hills Bar Association</a></p><p>Following the publication last week of the initial article stating concerns about Kalra’s loan and financial activity, <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-09-17/groundbreaking-court-filing-targets-judicial-corruption\" rel=\"ugc nofollow\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">Groundbreaking Court Filing Targets Judicial Corruption | ZeroHedge</a>  Kalra is \"reconsidering whether Cook could go forward\" with his lawsuit against the notary, whom Cook is claiming fraudulently allowed a loan of $730,000 to be affixed to his Dad.    Kalra had claimed that Cook “had no evidence\", but since the ZH article was published, Kalra appears more open-minded that evidence exists against the notary.  It should be noted that Cook has significant evidence against the notary, who was pivotal in executing the financial elder abuse scheme against Cook’s father, a scheme which judge Kalra may be trying to shield and protect.</p><p> And it wouldn’t be the first time that a judge tried to protect elder abuse. For a more thorough rendition of this agenda, you might want to read Dr. Sam Sugar’s book, “Guardianships and the Elderly: The Perfect Crime.” <a

It has been noted the alarming tendency of the US to name its killing programs as the opposite. Therefore, the words describing adult guardianships as something intended to protect the elderly need to be viewed as contrary to their reality. Over and over again, these guardianships have been proven to accomplish the exact opposite and have resulted in predation of the assets of the wards as well as outright medicalized attacks on their viability  \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2025-03-24/are-elderly-being-dosed-dangerous-antipsychotic-drugs\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\" shape=\\\"rect\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eAre the Elderly Being Dosed with Dangerous Antipsychotic Drugs? | ZeroHedge\\u003c/a\\u003e. \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn plain language, this is called \\\"theft” and “murder.\\\" \\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePursuant to these documented perceptions, this reporter has focused her attention on the judges in these cases.

The attorney, Paul Cook, was attempting to recuse a judge who appears to have irregularities in his mortgage transactions, which you can read about here: \\u003ca href=\\\"https://jumpshare.com/s/zHadS31bQm6zGE27vIcs\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\" shape=\\\"rect\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eH. 170.1 Judge Kalra\\u003c/a\\u003e This judge appears to have issued one erroneous ruling after another against attorney Cook and was publicly and rather relentlessly making disparaging and unprofessional comments about Cook.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn the process of researching the article concerning Cook’s efforts to remove judge Kalra from his case this reporter came across another effort to recuse a LA Superior Court judge from a case. This effort was accompanied by no less than SEVENTEEN declarations by attorneys who had had the misfortune of appearing before judge Murphy. These declarations repeatedly revealed that judge Mary Ann Murphy was deprecating in her verbiage towards numerous attorneys and publicly made insulting comments about them. \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.dailyjournal.com/article/384498-17-attorneys-seek-disqualification-of-la-judge-citing-bias-abuse\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\" shape=\\\"rect\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003e17 attorneys seek disqualification of LA judge citing bias, abuse\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBut the judge prevailed here as well, and Murphy refused to step off the case. Unlike the petitioner in the above cited case, Paul Cook is moving ahead with his intention to remove the problematic judge from his case and will be shortly filing an appeal.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003e It is in Cook’s judge’s response to the Motion to Recuse that we find the Orwellian verbiage. Judge Upinder Kalra has indeed refused to accede to the Motion to Recuse and has ordered it to be stricken from the record. This means that the Motion to Recuse will be treated as if it does not exist. That in itself is redolent of Orwell's Ministry of Truth, which was regularly scrambling to delete politically inconvenient events from the \\\"official\\\" record.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA scrutiny of judge Kalra’s response to Cook’s Motion reveals that while Kalra does not take direct issue with the revelations of financial impropriety discussed in the Motion, he dismisses all of Cook’s concerns and states “Because the Statement is untimely, and does not disclose, on its face, any legal grounds for disqualification, the Court strikes it pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.4(b).” \\u003ca href=\\\"https://jumpshare.com/s/FljDLIgYxr4NTAhNP8Z6\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\" shape=\\\"rect\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eJudge Kalra's Order Strike Disqualification-min\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHe goes on to declare that Cook should have recused him back in February, rather than waiting until September and his recusal attempt is therefore “untimely,” rather than buttressed by the longevity of the judge’s rude and unprofessional language. Judge Kalra also references Cook’s concerns about his financial activities, stating that “…Plaintiff baselessly contends that there are certain financial irregularities in Judge Kalra’s real estate and corporate stock transactions that warrant disqualification; Plaintiff bases this allegation on financial disclosures dated February 24, 2020, February 15, 2021, and February 25, 2025.”\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHowever, this statement is untrue as Cook only recently had reason to become curious about Kalra, and it was at that point a source informed him of investigating his mortgages. The possibility that Kalra was using his real estate transactions to fraudulently self-enrich was thus not on Cook‘s radar until very recently. The use of mortgages to launder money is called “loanbacking” and is discussed here \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.compliancealert.org/view-blog/54/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\" shape=\\\"rect\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003eLoan Back Method of Money Laundering | Compliance Alert\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJudge Kalra has executed nearly $4 million in such transactions.
