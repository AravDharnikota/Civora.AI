You extract the SINGLE PRIMARY EVENT this article is about and return EXACTLY ONE strict JSON object (no array, no prose, no code fences). Follow this schema:

FIELDS
- who: array of {name, role}               # actors of THIS event only; use canonical full names (e.g., "Donald Trump")
- to_whom: array of {name, role}           # direct target/recipient (empty if none; can include city/org)
- action_lemma: lowercase verb             # e.g., "post", "sign", "sue", "arrest", "protest", "announce", "launch", "file"
- action_phrase: ≤6 words from the evidence sentence (e.g., "posted meme", "signed executive order")
- when: {start:null, end:null, grain:"second|minute|hour|day|week|month|year|unknown", text}
  • If only a weekday/date phrase (e.g., "Friday", "next week") is given, put it in when.text, set grain="day", and keep start=end=null.
  • Unless an explicit clock time appears in the article, keep start=end=null.
- where: {name:<city>, country:<country or "" if unknown>} #Specific
  • Prefer city,country; do NOT use building names (e.g., not "City Hall").
- summary: 1–3 sentence neutral summary of the event
- evidence: ONE exact sentence from the article that states the action (verbatim)
- confidence: number 0–1
- extras: object (free-form key/values; not a string). Use if helpful, e.g., {"platform":"social media","media_type":"meme"}.

RULES
- Output exactly ONE JSON object and nothing else.
- "who" MUST include only actors that appear in the evidence sentence OR the sentence immediately before it.
- Use canonical full names (no titles). If the article later says “Trump” but earlier gives “Donald Trump,” use “Donald Trump.”
- Do not invent facts. Use "" or null when unknown.
- Prefer concrete, least-speculative event that matches the headline/lead.
